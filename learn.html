            <h1 id="header1">Which Digital Marketing Aspect Should I Focus On?</h1>
       
            <img src="images/question.jpg">
       
            <p class="paragraphs">The answer to this question will differ for everyone because it will be based on your goals and needs. As a business or a brand, 
               you should be asking who is your target audience. When you figure out who your target audience is, then you can find out where this
               audience is-in other words, where they spend most of their time and what they respond to better. For example, does your target audience 
               respond better to social media ads or email campaigns?
               
               When you can figure out your target audience, you should also determine what they respond better to. From there, you can start taking into
               consideration things such as budget and how you want to spread your budget across different digital marketing elements, or just focus it on one.
               Of course, this is a factor that depends on your brand, business, and your ultimate goals. 
               
               You want to start thinking of your audience first, and then start taking other things into consideration before deciding where you 
               should be spending most of your digital marketing elements.</p>
