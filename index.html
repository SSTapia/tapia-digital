        <p class="paragraphs">When some people hear the term, "Digital Marketing," 
        there's still a bit of confusion on what that actually is. Businesses 
        know they need a stronger online presence, but they don't know how 
        to go about building it. Job recruiters even find it difficult to 
        match talent to digital marketing jobs because a lot of them have 
        no idea what is actually needed to fill these roles. Let's face it - 
        businesses and influencers without digital marketing efforts in place 
        will ultimately be taken out by those that do. Whether you're a business 
        learning about building a strong online presence, or you're an upcoming 
        social media influencer, understanding what exactly digital marketing is,
        and the elements it composes of, will be your first start to staying 
        competitive as a business or a brand.</p>

        <h2 id="header2">The Digital Marketing Impact</h2>
    
    
        <p class="paragraphs"> Digital marketing has its impact-and it can be good or bad. A number of 
        businesses are reallocating money from traditional marketing efforts to
        digital marketing, as businesses across the board are paying attention to 
        the number of brick and mortar stores closing. A number of these closings 
        are related to the increase of e-commerce, making it easier for increased
        competition, including from those with small budgets, but know how to 
        make a profit selling items online. While more business is conducted online,
        so has marketing and advertising efforts, saving companies - both big and 
        small - a lot of money on expensive traditional marketing and advertising
        efforts - and it's paying off big time!</p>
